This challenge for Customer_Banking was quite straight forward in regards to what's being asked for since everything is laid out in pseudocode to help break down the problem.
Since there's a lot to go back and forth in regards to the different files I made sure to take time in each filed before continuing and then going back once finished to proofread and further understand the challenge.
Seeing how everything comes together for the final piece has been rewarding as well.
