This challenge for Customer_Banking was quite straight forward in regards to what's being asked for since everything is laid out in pseudocode to help break down the problem.

Since there's a lot to go back and forth in regards to the different files I made sure to take time in each filed before continuing and then going back once finished to proofread and further understand the challenge.
Having the right variable to connect throughout each file was something I felt like I needed to go back and forth about just in case.

Doing this challenge has helped enlightened me on how bigger projects can be formed and how they can be broken down even more with the import syntax so that way there isn't a clutter of code under one file.
